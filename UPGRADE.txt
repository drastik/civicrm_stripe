As of 2/12/14 there is no proper upgrade script to use this code with an existing
installation.  You can use if you know what you're doing and are prepared to make 
changes to your database.  Here's what you should be aware of.  Your data is in 
bad shape if you have subscriptions. The fees are missing from any subscription 
related contribution. Your live Stripe customers _might_ be marked as test in
civicrm_stripe_customers. (Since email is a unique key, it's either or. Test
customers can't make live transactions.) You should remove any subscription id
in the trxn_id field of civicrm_contribution and put that value in the respective
field in the new subcsription_id column of civicrm_stripe_subscriptions. For
record keeping you can also put it in the trxn_id of civicrm_contribution_recur.
In civicrm_contribution where you removed a subscription id, replace that with
the charge id related to the first invoice related to that subscription. For each 
contribution using Stripe that is missing a fee_amount and net_amount, insert them.
